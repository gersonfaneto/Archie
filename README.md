> "Many computer software programs store their configuration settings in plain, text-based
> files or directories. Dotfiles are configuration files for various programs, and they
> help those programs manage their functionality. What sets them apart from regular files
> and directories is their prefix. Dotfiles are named that way because each file and directory
> starts with a dot (.) On Unix based systems, dotfiles are hidden by the Operating System by default."
