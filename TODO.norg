* TODOs

  - ( ) Refactor/Updated `JARVIS`.

  - ( ) Adopt Gruvbox as the *only* theme. I really don't use the others anyway...

  -- Maybe create a system to easily generate the necessary theme files, based
     on a specific pallet...

  - (-) Check for bugs and improvements.

  - ( ) Improve the README and the overall documentation.
